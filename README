IBM-XCLI

This package provides an abstracted interface to the IBM XIV XCLI utility.

The IBM XIV XCLI is a utility providing a command line interface to an IBM XIV 
storage array exposing complete management and administrative functionality to 
the system.

The primary aim of this package is to provide a simplified and abstracted 
interface to the XCLI utility so as to reduce duplication of effort through 
reimlementation and to promote code reuse.

The larger portion of the methods exported by this package are "native" calls 
analagous to their corresponding XCLI counterparts; i.e. the vol_list method 
returns the same data as an execution of the native vol_list command would be 
expected to return.

The primary difference between the implementation of these "native" calls and 
their counterparts is the abscense of the column headers in the return values.  
This is done to remove the need for any unnessecary additional client side 
post-processing of return values and to maintain a level of consistency in 
expected return values.

All "native" calls are implemented using CSV output for deliniation of values.

The XCLI utility must be installed on the same machine as from which the 
script is ran.
