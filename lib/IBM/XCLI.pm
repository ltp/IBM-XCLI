IBM::XCLI - A Perl interface to the IBM XIV XCLI

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use IBM::XCLI;
	
	my $xiv = IBM::XCLI->new(	
				ip_address	=>	$ip_address,
				username	=>	$user
				password	=>	$password,
				xcli		=>	$xcli
			);

	}
	

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a simple object oriented interface to the IBM XIV XCLI utility.

The IBM XIV XCLI is a utility providing a command line interface to an IBM XIV storage array
exposing complete management and administrative capabilities of the system.

This module provides a simple interface to the IBM XIV XCLI utility by providing convenient
wrapper methods for a number of XCLI native method calls.  These methods are named for and are
analagous to their corresponding XCLI counterparts; for example, a call to the vol_list method
exposed by this module returns the same data as would an execution of the native vol_list
command would be expected to return.

The primary difference between the return value of method calls exposed by this module and 
the return value of native XCLI calls is that methods in this module using native method names 
return a nested hash rather than whitespace delimited or comma-separated data.

Note that if access to the raw data as returned by the XCLI native method call is required then
the B<raw> methods can be used to retrieve CSV data as retured directly from the XCLI.  See the
B<RAW METHODS> section below for further details.

The XCLI utility must be installed on the same machine as from which the script is ran.

=head1 METHODS
